# Yoru Learning Arc

## Gameplan

Main goal is to be able to take as many fights as possible as fast as possible.

### Attack

- For fast hits, send teleport to locations on the site we want to hit. i.e. short to A hell on haven
- For slow burns, im planning on sending teleports to sites we want to end on, playing the middle of the map for picks, lurking in the middle of the map while team explodes site after faking. The goal here would be to send tp behind the team while they hit site, lurk mid and pick off people rotating to the bomb.
- Send gatecrash into spawn Get a pick and teleport or continue pushing.

### Defense

The goal is to play fast rotate against agressive teams, and lurking teleport plays against teams playing slow by baiting with flash and clone. Having two charges of gatecrash allows me to play quick rotate twice because of how long they last.

### (The not sure yet maps) Lotus/Pearl/Ascent

Play Jett/Chamber the rest of the time in 5 stacks. Probably prefer Jett. You should learn and use a movement agent to get used to pressing buttons while trying to aim.
I will get to the other 3 maps eventually. Those are actually pretty good chamber maps if i really want to play him and if not then i play Jett and own. That allow for a lot of good rotation and a lot of good opportunities to operator.
